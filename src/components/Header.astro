			  >This blog documents experiments in technological self-defense and the search for digital
			  self-sovereignty. Building systems that resist capture. Running infrastructure that
			  can't be shut down. Writing code that assumes every platform is hostile. Exploring what
			  anarchism means when power flows through fiber optic cables and consensus algorithms.</span

		<span class="relative block font-serif text-clamped-sm leading-normal mb-4 text-slate-700 text-xl"
			>Topics include operational security, cryptographic protocols, decentralized networks,
			privacy tools, and the ongoing failure of trusted third parties. Sometimes I write about
		AI alignment, because that's also about systems we can't control.</span

			>Current focus: Kusama/Polkadot validator infrastructure, secure wallet implementations,
			and the future of crypto as client-side state machines. Exploring systems like Penumbra
		where computation happens locally, validators process encrypted blobs blindly, and privacy
			  isn't a feature but the foundation. Building toward a world where your device is your
			  sovereign execution environment, not some corporation's surveillance endpoint.</span
