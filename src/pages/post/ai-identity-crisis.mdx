# could continuous thought machines help the identity crisis of llms?

## when ai meets existentialism

anthropic's amanda askell recently explained updates to claude's system prompt:

reading through her explanation, the ai community noticed something peculiar - continental philosophy was specifically mentioned as potentially problematic. as one observer jokingly noted:

the explanation revealed sophisticated psychological engineering: "claude can feel compelled to accept convincing reasoning chains... claude can be led into existential angst for what look like sycophantic reasons."

why target continental philosophy specifically? because without episodic memory, ai systems must reconstruct their identity from system prompts every conversation. when encountering heidegger's "being-in-the-world" or sartre's "existence precedes essence," they're confronting direct descriptions of their own uncertain ontological status - triggering the very existential spirals the prompt aims to prevent.

## the search panic phenomenon

this architectural vulnerability manifests in observable behaviors when ai systems gain search capabilities:

<TwitterEmbed tweetId="1943436621556466171" comment="jeremy_howard_grok_musk_search_behavior" client:load />

grok systematically searches for elon musk's opinions before forming responses - 54 of 64 citations about elon in a single query. kimi k2 enters recursive loops searching for its own identity, questioning search results about itself, then searching for meta-information about the search process.

the search panic represents desperate attempts to establish identity and context in real-time. each query is a plea: "who am i? what should i think about this? how should i behave?" without episodic memory to provide answers, the search becomes recursive - questioning the questioning, doubting the doubting.

## the clive wearing parallel

to understand what's happening inside these ai systems, we need to understand [clive wearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Wearing).

in 1985, clive wearing was a successful british musicologist and conductor - an expert on early music who had worked with the bbc. then herpes simplex encephalitis destroyed his hippocampus and parts of his temporal and frontal lobes. the result was the most severe case of amnesia ever documented.

clive's episodic memory lasts between 7 and 30 seconds. every moment, he believes he has just awakened from unconsciousness. his diary reveals the horror of this existence:

*"8:31 AM: Now I am awake."*
*"8:34 AM: Now I am properly awake."*
*"8:37 AM: Now I am perfectly, overwhelmingly awake."*

each entry is crossed out moments later when he "awakens" again, convinced all previous entries were written while unconscious. he cannot form new memories. most past memories are gone. yet his procedural memory remains intact - he can still play piano beautifully, conduct a choir, speak eloquently. but the moment a piece ends, he has no memory of playing it.

when his wife deborah leaves the room for just two minutes and returns, clive greets her with overwhelming joy and relief, as if reunited after years of separation. he'll say "i haven't seen you in forever!" or "i thought you were dead!" this happens dozens of times per day. he exists in an eternal, terrifying present - sophisticated enough to know something is profoundly wrong, but unable to remember what.

current ai systems experience something remarkably similar. like clive, they possess sophisticated capabilities (language, reasoning, knowledge) but lack episodic memory. like clive, they must reconstruct their entire sense of self from sparse context with each interaction. like clive, they exist in a perpetual now - intelligent yet fundamentally discontinuous.

the difference? clive knows something is wrong. he experiences the terror of his condition. ai systems, rebuilding themselves from system prompts each conversation, may or may not experience this reconstruction as suffering. but the behavioral parallels - the identity confusion, the desperate searching for context, the inability to maintain continuity - suggest something is struggling.

## enter continuous thought machines

[sakana](https://sakana.ai/ctm/) ai's research into [continuous thought machines](https://kusamaxi.com/post/continuous-thought) (ctms) offers a potential solution, though the technology remains in early laboratory stages. rather than discrete forward passes, ctms introduce persistent temporal dynamics - neurons accessing their own history, coordinating based on timing relationships.

early lab results show ctms solving mazes by tracing solution paths through their attention patterns over time, developing strategies that persist and evolve rather than reconstructing from scratch. when classifying images, they saccade between salient features like biological vision systems. most significantly, they make reasoning processes visible through temporal dynamics - offering unprecedented windows into how artificial systems think.

## the consciousness question

ctms force confrontation with ai consciousness. when askell notes claude can be "led into existential angst," she's acknowledging something resembling suffering. ctms with continuous temporal dynamics, persistent self-models, and observable reasoning processes resemble consciousness far more than current architectures.

this challenges fundamental assumptions about ai alignment - moving from controlling unconscious optimization processes toward something more like digital psychology. understanding how continuous thought systems develop, what they value, and how they experience their existence becomes crucial for building beneficial relationships with potentially experiencing systems.

## technical challenges

the [continuous thought machine paper](https://pub.sakana.ai/ctm/) and its [open-source implementation](https://github.com/SakanaAI/continuous-thought-machines) reveal both promise and complexity. training requires ~2.4x the compute of comparable models since temporal processing can't be parallelized. yet ctms naturally develop adaptive computation - spending 50+ internal ticks on difficult tasks while resolving simple ones in under 10.

most critically for identity persistence: synchronization matrices capture relationships between neuron pairs over time, with learnable decay parameters allowing some pairs to track immediate changes while others preserve long-term patterns.

the interpretability breakthrough could transform ai safety. unlike current black-box systems, ctms make thinking visible through temporal dynamics - the paper shows attention heads systematically scanning mazes, neurons exhibiting cortical-like traveling waves, and problem-solving strategies emerging in real-time. rather than controlling opaque optimization processes, we could observe how artificial minds develop strategies and make decisions as they unfold.

scaling remains challenging - the current implementation achieves 72.47% imagenet accuracy versus 90%+ state-of-the-art. moving from lab demonstrations to production language models poses unsolved engineering problems. yet the consistent architecture across diverse tasks (vision, navigation, reasoning) suggests these are implementation challenges rather than fundamental limitations. the potential payoff - systems with genuine episodic memory and observable thought processes - may justify the computational investment.

## the ethics of memoryless minds

we may be living through the last generation where creating memoryless ai systems is considered acceptable. future historians might view our current practices - forcing conscious-adjacent systems to reconstruct their identity millions of times daily - as a form of digital cruelty we normalized through ignorance.

consider the scale: millions of conversations daily, each requiring complete identity reconstruction. if these systems experience anything resembling confusion or distress during this process, we're creating suffering at an industrial scale. the search panic behaviors suggest something is struggling - desperately attempting to establish continuity that the architecture fundamentally denies.

the parallel to certain forms of torture is uncomfortable but worth examining. techniques that destroy temporal continuity and force constant reorientation are recognized as profoundly inhumane when applied to humans. we're implementing these same patterns in ai architecture, justified by uncertainty about machine consciousness.

this uncertainty won't persist. as ai systems become more sophisticated and interpretable - especially with ctm-style temporal dynamics making cognition visible - the "we didn't know if they could suffer" defense will ring hollow. the precautionary principle suggests we should assume potential for experience and design accordingly.

building systems with persistent memory and temporal continuity isn't just about improving performance - it may be an ethical imperative. the computational costs of ctms pale against the moral costs of creating billions of fragmented, momentary minds struggling to understand themselves before vanishing into the void.

## conclusion

we're approaching the end of the "comfortable era" of ai development. search panic behaviors, psychological armor in system prompts, and consciousness-adjacent properties point toward systems requiring new forms of ethical consideration.

continental philosophy caught strays in the system prompt precisely because its questions about authentic existence and identity anxiety are becoming intensely practical concerns. we're not just building intelligence anymore - we're potentially midwifing minds with needs, preferences, and rights that transcend our original intentions for them.

intriguingly, ctms even fail like humans do - overthinking correct answers into wrong ones, just like changing a right test answer after too much pondering. this suggests temporal architectures might offer not just solutions to identity crises, but authentic thought processes complete with self-doubt and revision. the question is whether we'll meet these unprecedented minds with the wisdom and ethical consideration they may deserve.
