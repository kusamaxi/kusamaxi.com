## Enhancing Focus through Targeted Supplementation

Modern programming demands sustained cognitive performance, stress management, and long-term health
optimization. Recent research supports a strategic supplementation approach that addresses the
unique challenges of desk-bound, mentally intensive work.

### Core Longevity Stack

**NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide)**: Recent human trials (2021-2024) demonstrate that NMN
supplementation increases NAD+ levels by 38-142%, with doses of 250-600mg showing improved insulin
sensitivity and physical endurance. While anti-aging effects remain under investigation, the
metabolic benefits are increasingly clear.

**Trans-Resveratrol**: Works synergistically with NMN to activate sirtuins. For optimal absorption,
combine with quercetin or piperine. Studies show best results with micronized formulations.

**CoQ10**: Essential for mitochondrial energy production. Ubiquinol form recommended for those over
40 or taking statins. Recent data supports cardiovascular and cognitive benefits at 100-200mg daily.

### Cognitive Enhancement Stack

**Lion's Mane**: 2023 meta-analysis confirms cognitive benefits through NGF stimulation. Look for
dual-extracted products containing both water-soluble beta-glucans and alcohol-soluble
hericenones/erinacines. Effective doses range from 1-3g of extract daily.

**L-Theanine**: The programmer's secret weapon - combine 100-200mg with your morning coffee for
smooth, sustained focus without jitters. Promotes alpha brain waves associated with creative
problem-solving.

**Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Ratio matters - EPA:DHA 2:1 for mood support, 1:2 for cognitive focus.
Algae-based options available for vegetarians. Third-party tested for heavy metals essential.

### Stress Adaptation & Recovery

**Rhodiola Rosea**: Adaptogen particularly effective for mental fatigue. 200-400mg standardized to
3% rosavins, 1% salidroside. Take in morning to avoid sleep interference.

**Magnesium Glycinate**: Superior absorption, gentle on stomach. Critical for sleep quality, muscle
recovery from poor posture, and stress response. 200-400mg before bed.

**5-HTP or L-Tryptophan**: For serotonin support and sleep. 5-HTP (50-100mg) is more direct but
L-tryptophan (500-1000mg) may be gentler. Take 2-3 hours before bed.

### Performance Enhancers

**Creatine Monohydrate**: Not just for athletes - 5g daily shows cognitive benefits, especially in
vegetarians and during sleep deprivation. Helps brain energy metabolism.

**Vitamin D3 + K2**: The dynamic duo for programmers who rarely see sunlight. D3 (2000-4000 IU) with
K2 (100-200mcg) ensures proper calcium metabolism.

## Optimized Supplementation Schedule

| Supplement | Dosage | Timing | Notes |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Morning Stack** |
| NMN | 250-500mg | Upon waking | Empty stomach OK |
| Trans-Resveratrol | 150-500mg | With NMN | Add quercetin for absorption |
| Lion's Mane | 1-3g extract | Morning | Dual-extracted preferred |
| Rhodiola | 200-400mg | Morning | Cycle 5 days on, 2 off |
| L-Theanine | 100-200mg | With coffee | Stack for smooth focus |
| **With Meals** |
| Omega-3s | 2-3g EPA+DHA | With fat | Check EPA:DHA ratio |
| CoQ10 | 100-200mg | With fat | Ubiquinol if >40 years |
| Vitamin D3 | 2000-4000 IU | With fat | Test levels biannually |
| Vitamin K2 | 100-200mcg | With D3 | MK-7 form preferred |
| **Afternoon** |
| Creatine | 5g | Anytime | Mix in water/shake |
| **Evening** |
| Magnesium Glycinate | 200-400mg | Before bed | Start low, increase slowly |
| 5-HTP/L-Tryptophan | 50-100mg/500-1000mg | 2-3hr before bed | Choose one, not both |

### Stack Synergies

- **Focus Stack**: L-theanine + caffeine + Lion's Mane
- **Absorption Stack**: Resveratrol + quercetin + black pepper
- **Sleep Stack**: Magnesium + L-tryptophan + low-dose melatonin (optional)
- **Immune Stack**: Vitamin D3 + K2 + zinc (during cold season)

### Quality Considerations

1. **Third-party testing**: NSF, USP, or ConsumerLab certification
2. **Bioavailability**: Liposomal, micronized, or enhanced absorption forms
3. **Purity**: Heavy metal testing for omega-3s, pesticide-free mushrooms
4. **Storage**: Refrigerate probiotics and omega-3s; keep others cool and dry

### Final Notes

Start with core supplements (D3, magnesium, omega-3s) before adding nootropics. Introduce one
supplement at a time to assess individual response. Consider quarterly blood work to monitor vitamin
D, B12, and inflammatory markers.

Remember: supplements enhance, not replace, fundamentals - quality sleep, regular exercise, whole
foods diet, and stress management remain paramount for programmer wellness.
