# When Validators Won't Update: Economic Incentives for Network Participation

## Abstract

This analysis examines the introduction of approval slashes in Polkadot's consensus mechanism,
implemented via PR #6827. The modification addresses a critical problem: validators running outdated
software or shirking their verification duties without consequences. Through analysis of a 23-hour
network outage caused by validators failing to update their clients, we demonstrate why economic
penalties are necessary to maintain network health.

## The Core Problem: Passive Participation

Polkadot's security model assumes active, engaged validators who:
- Keep their client software updated
- Actually verify the blocks they're supposed to check
- Participate constructively in dispute resolution

Reality showed otherwise. The network's penalty structure created a perverse incentive: validators
could collect rewards while doing the bare minimum, running ancient client versions, and
rubber-stamping approvals without real verification.

## The Kusama Wake-Up Call

In May 2025, this theoretical vulnerability became a 23-hour nightmare:

### What Happened
- 40+ validators hadn't updated their clients in months (still running < v1.17)
- These outdated nodes couldn't understand the new candidate receipt format (RFC-103)
- They started disputing perfectly valid blocks, thinking they were invalid
- The dispute avalanche brought finality to a grinding halt

### Why It Matters
This wasn't a sophisticated attack or edge case bug. It was validators simply not doing their job:
staying current with network upgrades. The incident revealed that without economic consequences,
a significant portion of validators will inevitably fall behind, creating systemic risk.

## The Economic Fix

The solution: make negligence costly. The new penalty structure introduces:

```rust
pub enum DisputeOffenceKind {
    ForInvalidBacked,     // 100% stake slash - you proposed garbage
    ForInvalidApproved,   // 2% stake slash - you approved garbage
    AgainstValid,         // Era ban - you disputed good blocks
}
```

### Why These Numbers Matter

**100% for backing invalid blocks**: This stays unchanged. If you're the primary validator proposing
blocks, you better be damn sure they're valid.

**2% for approving invalid blocks**: New addition. Forces approval checkers to actually check
instead of blindly signing off. Small enough to not be catastrophic, large enough to hurt.

**Era disablement for false disputes**: Prevents spam without being overly punitive for honest
mistakes or version mismatches.

## Game Theory Shift

Before: "Why bother updating? Why spend CPU actually checking? Others will handle it."

After: "If I don't update and actively verify, I'm risking real money."

The free-rider problem disappears when free riding has a price tag.

## What This Means for Validators

1. **Update or pay**: Running outdated clients is now an expensive mistake
2. **Verify or pay**: Rubber-stamping approvals without checking risks your stake  
3. **Think before disputing**: False accusations get you temporarily banned

The message is clear: passive participation is no longer viable. Either actively maintain your
infrastructure and fulfill your duties, or find another network to validate.

## Network-Wide Benefits

- **Faster upgrades**: Economic pressure ensures validators update promptly
- **Real verification**: Approval checking becomes actual checking, not theater
- **Fewer false disputes**: Validators think twice before crying wolf
- **Better finality**: Active, updated validators mean smoother consensus

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just about punishing bad actors - it's about aligning incentives with network needs.
Decentralized networks only work when participants actively contribute. By making passive
participation expensive, Polkadot ensures its validators remain engaged, updated, and accountable.

The Kusama incident showed what happens when validators can coast: critical network functions fail
not from attacks, but from apathy. These economic updates ensure that won't happen again.

## Conclusion

The approval slashes update fundamentally changes the validator experience from optional
participation to mandatory engagement. In a space where "code is law," this update adds an
important corollary: "and law has consequences."

For validators, the message is simple: stay updated, do your job, or pay the price. For the
network, it means a more reliable, responsive, and resilient consensus mechanism where security
doesn't depend on goodwill alone.
