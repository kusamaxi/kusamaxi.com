## Did Telenova Wallet Solve the UX Problem Of Crypto?

The [source
code](https://github.com/novasamatech/telenova-web-app/blob/57b937bdcd199e4ae072b4591382f46a7fed246a/src/common/wallet/store.ts)
for [Telenova Wallet](https://t.me/telenova_app_bot) has been released, marking its true release
	date in our opinion. Without source code transparency, users cannot verify they alone control
	their keys - a fundamental requirement for any cryptocurrency wallet.

## Cryptographic Security

Telenova employs robust cryptographic techniques to secure user assets. The wallet uses AES
encryption combined with Scrypt key derivation to protect mnemonic phrases - the foundation for
generating key pairs. By deriving unique encryption keys from user passwords and random salts, the
wallet ensures mnemonics remain secure even if encrypted data is exposed.

The encryption process generates a random salt and uses Scrypt to derive a key from the user's
password. This key encrypts the mnemonic using AES in CBC mode. The encrypted mnemonic and salt are
stored together securely. During decryption, the salt is extracted and the key is re-derived from
the password to decrypt the mnemonic.

## Key Management

The wallet efficiently manages cryptographic keys by generating and securely storing mnemonic
phrases and associated key pairs. Mnemonics are encrypted and stored locally, with optional Telegram
Cloud Storage backup. This dual-storage approach balances convenience and security - users can
easily recover wallets while keeping private keys protected.

## User Experience Excellence

Designed with user-friendliness at its core, Telenova simplifies onboarding to just two clicks for
account creation. This streamlined experience makes cryptocurrency accessible to new users without
compromising security. Secure local storage and unique store names based on Telegram IDs ensure
access remains both secure and conflict-free.

## Security Recommendations

Telenova Wallet suits managing small to medium amounts - think monthly salaries or daily expenses.
Security depends primarily on password strength, making robust, unique passwords crucial. Long,
complex passwords mixing letters, numbers, and special characters significantly enhance protection.

This design deliberately balances user experience with security, enabling Web2 users to transition
to Web3 without managing raw key pairs. However, with LLM-powered password crackers exploiting
personal data becoming more sophisticated, password-only security faces increasing challenges. For
larger amounts, we recommend offline wallet setups as detailed in [this
guide](https://kusamaxi.com/post/robust-vault-wallets).

## Areas for Enhancement

Future improvements could include:
- Consolidating all assets into an asset hub with teleport options for legacy relaychain assets
- Optimizing RPC endpoint selection for better UX - current node selection creates some lag
- Migrating to the new polkadot-api library instead of legacy versions, enabling light clients for
  more secure and faster blockchain interactions
- Implementing IBP/Dotters GeoDNS to prioritize low-latency RPC endpoints

## Verdict

[Telenova Wallet](https://t.me/telenova_app_bot) stands out as a reliable, user-friendly
cryptocurrency management solution. Its robust encryption, efficient key management, and intuitive
interface make it optimal for everyday transactions and entry-level amounts.

After reviewing the source code and evaluating the cryptographic scheme, we highly recommend
Telenova Wallet for onboarding friends into crypto. Gift them some KSM or USDT through Telenova -
it's the smoothest introduction to Web3 they'll find.
